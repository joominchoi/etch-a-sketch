# The Odin Project: Etch-a-Sketch Project

Building a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch

**WIP:**
- Bonus step 1

**Steps:**
1. Create grid of square divs.
2. Set up a "hover" effect so that the grid divs change color when mouse passes over them.
3. Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before.

**Bonus challenges:**
1. Rather than a simple color change from black to white, each interaction should randomize the squareâ€™s RGB value entirely.
2. Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square. The objective is to achieve a completely black square only after ten interactions.


**Thoughts:** \
This was a thoroughly enjoyable project with many new learnings and a recapping of basic programming best practices. Of course there were frustrations along the way, but I was again reminded of the following:
- Tackle one problem at a time
- Don't be afraid to approach a problem from different angles
- Don't be precious of code! Commit regularly and make use of Git
- Don't try to come up with the most optimal code from the get go. Get a working solution going first and then refactor.
- Write down my ideas for solutions on pen and paper to untangle mind

**Learnings:**
- grid-template-columns
- Using a loop function to create a grid
- [Element: mouseover event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseover_event#event_properties)
- How to get and set CSS property with Javascript: [Change the grid-template-columns Property with JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.php?filename=trycss_js_grid-template-columns)
- HTMLCollection and how to remove them

**Recapping:**
- Putting code into functions so they are reusable
